# Small businesses member card managment

A friend of mine, as an indipendent Yoga teacher is still using papers, to manage her students, and their 10-entry-cards
This should be her small solution to keep everything up to date.

## Who Should this be to?
any small business that is willing to get paid in advanced for their services. 
Like my friend - she gets paid for 10 classes, and the students wont need to bring their cards with them. 
It will be easy and simple to use.

## Status: under construction
In the future, i'll update here, and describe what is planned here..


# IMPORTANT NOTES:

* To save time on setup, i cloned a working example project from: 
[github](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary/nextjs-appwrite-auth)
